# Homework-12--Plotly

This homework pulls data out of a sqlite datbase and renders a couple different charts to visual bacterial growth.  There were a couple different sets of instructions out there for deploying the app.   The final trick involved the Procfile definitions.  It was unclear what name should be put in the application.  

Deployed the app to Heroku here:
